/**
 * Check if a candidate repeats the last step.
 * 
 * Heuristic:
 * - If the last step applied the same rule to the same target path, it's a loop.
 * - Ideally, we should check if the *result* of the step leads to a previous state, 
 *   but we don't know the result yet.
 * - So we rely on "don't do the exact same thing twice in a row".
 * - Actually, "same rule at same path" might be valid if the state changed (e.g. simplify again).
 * - But for V1.1, let's prevent "A -> B -> A" loops if possible.
 * - Since we only have history of *steps*, not states (in the snapshot passed here, though snapshot has steps),
 *   we can check if the last step was the "inverse" or if we are just repeating.
 * 
 * For now, a very simple check:
 * - If the last step used rule X on path Y, don't use rule X on path Y again immediately?
 *   No, that prevents valid repeated applications (e.g. simplify 2/4 then 3/6 if they were at same path? No, path would change or content change).
 * 
 * Let's implement a specific check for the "3/1 * 1" loop.
 * If we just did "3 -> 3/1", we don't want to do "3/1 -> 3" (if we had such a rule).
 * 
 * But the user requirement says: "Filter out candidates that repeat the last step".
 * This usually means "don't apply the same rule to the same location if it didn't change anything".
 * But MapMaster only proposes applicable rules.
 * 
 * Let's assume "repetitive" means "we just did this exact step".
 * But we can't do the exact same step because the state changed (unless the step was a no-op).
 * 
 * Maybe "looping" means "we are undoing the last step"?
 * e.g. "3/1 -> 3" after "3 -> 3/1".
 * 
 * For this task, let's implement a placeholder `isCandidateRepetitive` that returns false,
 * unless we identify a specific loop pattern we want to block.
 * 
 * Wait, the prompt says: "ensure that StepMaster accepts StepHistorySnapshot to avoid repeating just executed steps".
 * 
 * Let's check if the candidate is identical to the last step's intent.
 * If `lastStep.ruleId === candidate.ruleId` and `lastStep.path === candidate.path`, 
 * it might be a loop if the rule is idempotent or if the previous application failed to change state enough to disable the rule.
 * 
 * Let's block it if it matches the last step exactly.
